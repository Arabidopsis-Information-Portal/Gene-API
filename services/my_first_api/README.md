#my_first_api_v0.1

## Synopsis

###My First Gene API
This is the first API that I made.
Perform three main functions. Search for a specific geneID to return a specified field about that gene. Search for a geneID with a * to return a list of matching geneIDs. Enter just a * to return a list of all geneIDs.

The file format for this API contained of a main.py with the API operations. Then a searchFunctions.py which contained commonly used functions for the main.py and other Python mediators to use.

## Notes

Developed mainly used to test Intermine functions.
This API is not published on Araport.
