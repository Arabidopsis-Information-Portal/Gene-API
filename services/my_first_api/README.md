#My First Gene API
This is the first API that I made.
Perform three main functions. Search for a specific geneID to return a specified field about that gene. Search for a geneID with a * to return a list of matching geneIDs. Enter just a * to return a list of all geneIDs.

Mainly used to test Intermine functions. This API is not published on Araport.
