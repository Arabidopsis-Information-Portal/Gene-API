#gene_by_geneid_v0.2.1

## Synopsis

###Araport API that serves basic information about genes.

The main goal for this API was to search for a specific geneID and return chromosome information.
Another function, list, would be used to list all 30000+ geneIDs.

## Notes

v0.2 is the final version. If there are any bugs or other issues, please let me know. Thanks.
v0.2.1 is a test for adding a constraint of "AT*" to see if it works faster.
