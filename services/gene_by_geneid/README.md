#gene_by_geneid_v0.2

## Synopsis

###Araport API that serves basic information about genes.

The main goal for this API was to search for a specific geneID and return chromosome information.
Another function, list, would be used to list all 30000+ geneIDs.

## Notes

v0.2 is still a WIP.

v0.2 works fine on the command line so far.

Testing, cleanup, and commenting.

v0.2 is not yet on araport.org.
